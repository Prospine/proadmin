# Security Policy

**Effective Date:** October 11, 2025

ProSpine Clinic is committed to maintaining the security and integrity of the ProSpine Clinic Management Dashboard (the "Software") and the data it processes. This Security Policy outlines our approach to protecting information and responding to security incidents.

## 1. Security Practices

- **Access Control:** Only authorized users with valid credentials can access the Software. Role-based permissions restrict access to sensitive data and features.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/SSL. Where applicable, data at rest is also encrypted.
- **Authentication:** Strong password policies are enforced. User sessions are managed securely with automatic timeouts and re-authentication requirements.
- **Audit Logging:** All critical actions (login, data changes, deletions) are logged and monitored for suspicious activity.
- **Regular Updates:** The Software is regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities and apply best practices.
- **Data Backups:** Regular backups are performed and stored securely to ensure data availability and integrity.

## 2. Vulnerability Management

- **Monitoring:** We monitor for security threats and vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual reviews.
- **Patch Management:** Security patches are applied promptly upon discovery of vulnerabilities.
- **Third-Party Dependencies:** All third-party libraries and dependencies are reviewed and kept up to date.

## 3. Incident Response

- **Reporting:** Users and staff are encouraged to report security issues or suspicious activity immediately to our IT team at [https://prospine.in/contact.html](https://prospine.in/contact.html).
- **Response:** Upon receiving a report, we will investigate, contain, and remediate the issue as quickly as possible. Affected users will be notified if their data is impacted.
- **Post-Incident Review:** After any incident, we conduct a review to improve our security measures and prevent recurrence.

## 4. User Responsibilities

- Users must keep their credentials confidential and report any suspected compromise immediately.
- Users should log out after each session and avoid accessing the Software from public or unsecured devices.

## 5. Compliance

- We strive to comply with applicable data protection and privacy regulations relevant to our operations and the jurisdictions in which we operate.
