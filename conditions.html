            "disc-prolapse": {
                title: "Disc Prolapse (Slipped Disc)",
                overview: "A disc prolapse, commonly known as a slipped or herniated disc, occurs when the soft, jelly-like center of a spinal disc (the nucleus pulposus) pushes out through a tear in the tougher, outer ring (the annulus fibrosus). This can cause irritation or compression of nearby spinal nerves, leading to pain and other symptoms. While it sounds scary, most cases resolve with non-surgical treatments.",
                anatomy: "The spine is made up of a stack of bones called vertebrae, with intervertebral discs acting as cushions between them. These discs are like little shock absorbers, with a tough outer layer and a soft inner core. A disc prolapse happens when the inner core squeezes out, often due to a crack or weakness in the outer layer.",
                symptoms: [
                    "Localized pain: Sharp or dull pain in the neck or lower back, often aggravated by movement.",
                    "Radiating pain: Pain that travels down the arms or legs, often following the path of the compressed nerve (e.g., sciatica).",
                    "Numbness or Tingling: A 'pins and needles' sensation or numbness in the area served by the affected nerve.",
                    "Muscle Weakness: Difficulty lifting things, holding objects, or experiencing a 'foot drop' if a nerve in the leg is affected.",
                    "Pain on exertion: Symptoms that worsen with bending, twisting, coughing, or sneezing due to increased pressure on the spine."
                ],
                causes: [
                    "Age-related degeneration: As we age, our spinal discs lose water content and flexibility, making them more prone to tearing. This is the most common cause.",
                    "Trauma or injury: A sudden injury, like a fall or a car accident, can cause a disc to rupture.",
                    "Poor lifting technique: Using your back instead of your legs to lift heavy objects can put immense pressure on the discs, leading to a prolapse.",
                    "Repetitive strain: Occupations or activities that involve frequent bending, twisting, or prolonged sitting can increase the risk.",
                    "Lifestyle factors: Being overweight or obese puts extra stress on the lower back. Smoking is also a risk factor as it can reduce oxygen supply to the discs, weakening them."
                ],
                diagnosis: "A doctor will typically start with a physical exam and a discussion of your symptoms. To confirm a disc prolapse and rule out other conditions, they may order imaging tests such as an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan, which provides a detailed look at the spinal discs and nerves. An X-ray might also be used to rule out other bone-related issues.",
                treatments: [
                    "Conservative Management (First-line): This is the most common approach. It includes a combination of:<ul><li>Rest and activity modification: Limiting activities that aggravate pain while staying as active as possible with low-impact exercises.</li><li>Medication: Over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers, muscle relaxants, or anti-inflammatory drugs to manage pain.</li><li>Physiotherapy: A physical therapist will guide you through specific exercises to strengthen the muscles supporting your spine and improve flexibility. They may also use techniques like massage, heat/cold therapy, or ultrasound.</li></ul>",
                    "Interventional Treatments: If conservative methods are not enough, a doctor may recommend:<ul><li>Epidural Steroid Injections: An injection of a steroid medication directly into the space around the spinal nerves to reduce inflammation and pain.</li><li>Nerve Blocks: A procedure to block pain signals from a specific nerve.</li></ul>",
                    "Surgical Intervention: Surgery is usually considered a last resort for severe, persistent pain, significant nerve compression, or when symptoms like severe weakness or loss of bladder/bowel control are present. The most common procedure is a microdiscectomy, where a small portion of the herniated disc is removed to relieve pressure on the nerve."
                ],
                prognosis: "The good news is that most people with a disc prolapse recover fully with conservative treatment within a few weeks to months. The disc can often shrink or be reabsorbed by the body over time, reducing pressure on the nerve. Adherence to physical therapy and lifestyle changes is key to long-term success and preventing recurrence."
            },

            "sciatica": {
                title: "Sciatica",
                overview: "Sciatica isn't a condition itself, but rather a symptom of an underlying problem that is irritating or compressing the sciatic nerve. It's characterized by pain that radiates from the lower back down through the hip and buttocks and into one leg. While the pain can be severe, it is usually manageable with non-surgical treatments.",
                anatomy: "The sciatic nerve is the longest and thickest nerve in the human body. It's formed by several nerve roots from the lower spine (L4 to S3). It runs from the lower back, through the buttocks, and branches down the back of each leg to the foot. When this nerve is compressed or inflamed, it causes the characteristic radiating pain known as sciatica.",
                symptoms: [
                    "Shooting or sharp pain: A distinct, often intense, pain that travels along the nerve's path, most commonly down the back of one leg.",
                    "Burning or tingling sensation: A feeling of 'pins and needles' or a burning sensation in the leg or foot.",
                    "Numbness or weakness: Reduced sensation or difficulty moving the affected leg or foot.",
                    "Pain that worsens with sitting: Sitting for long periods, coughing, or sneezing can increase pressure on the nerve, intensifying the pain."
                ],
                causes: [
                    "Herniated Disc: A slipped or prolapsed disc is the most common cause of sciatica, as the bulging disc material can press directly on the sciatic nerve root.",
                    "Spinal Stenosis: The narrowing of the spinal canal, which can put pressure on the nerves.",
                    "Piriformis Syndrome: A condition where the piriformis muscle in the buttock spasms or tightens, compressing the sciatic nerve that runs nearby.",
                    "Spondylolisthesis: A condition where one vertebra slips forward over the one below it, which can compress the nerve.",
                    "Other rare causes: Tumors or infections that put pressure on the nerve, or injury/trauma to the spine."
                ],
                diagnosis: "A doctor will review your medical history and perform a physical examination, including checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. They may ask you to perform certain movements to see what triggers the pain. Imaging tests like an MRI or CT scan may be used to identify the underlying cause of the nerve compression.",
                treatments: [
                    "Conservative Management: Most cases of sciatica respond well to these treatments:<ul><li>Physical Therapy and Exercise: A cornerstone of treatment. A physical therapist will teach you specific stretches and exercises to improve flexibility, strengthen the core muscles that support the spine, and reduce pressure on the nerve.</li><li>Pain Management: Over-the-counter pain relievers, muscle relaxants, or anti-inflammatory drugs. In some cases, short-term use of oral steroids may be prescribed.</li><li>Hot and Cold Therapy: Applying a cold pack to the painful area can help reduce inflammation, while heat can soothe muscle spasms and tension.</li></ul>",
                    "Interventional Treatments: If pain persists, a doctor might suggest:<ul><li>Epidural Steroid Injections: These are often very effective in providing short-term pain relief by reducing inflammation around the nerve root.</li></ul>",
                    "Surgery: Surgery for sciatica is rare and is only considered for severe cases, such as when there is significant muscle weakness, loss of bowel/bladder control, or if conservative treatments have failed to provide relief after a prolonged period."
                ],
                prognosis: "Sciatica symptoms can be frustrating, but the outlook is generally very positive. The pain often resolves on its own within a few weeks to months. With proper treatment and a commitment to a strengthening and stretching routine, many people can manage their symptoms and prevent future flare-ups."
            },


            "herniated-disc": {
                title: "Herniated Disc",
                overview: "A herniated disc, often interchangeably used with 'slipped disc' or 'ruptured disc,' occurs when a portion of the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc pushes out through a tear in the tougher outer layer. This displacement can irritate or put pressure on nearby spinal nerves, leading to symptoms that range from mild discomfort to significant pain and nerve-related issues. While the term may sound intimidating, most people find relief through non-surgical treatments.",
                anatomy: "Our spine is a column of stacked bones called vertebrae, and between each vertebra is a round, flat disc that acts as a cushion and shock absorber. Each disc has two parts: a soft, inner core (the nucleus pulposus) and a tough, fibrous outer ring (the annulus fibrosus). A herniated disc happens when a crack or weakness in the outer ring allows the inner core to bulge or protrude out.",
                symptoms: [
                    "Arm or Leg Pain (Radiculopathy): This is the most common symptom. If the herniated disc is in your lower back, you'll likely feel a sharp, shooting pain down your leg, often following the path of the sciatic nerve (sciatica). If it's in your neck, the pain will radiate into your shoulder and arm.",
                    "Numbness or Tingling: You might experience a 'pins and needles' sensation or numbness in the body part served by the compressed nerve. For example, a lower back herniation might cause numbness in your leg or foot.",
                    "Muscle Weakness: The muscles connected to the affected nerve may become weak, leading to difficulty lifting or holding objects, or even stumbling if the nerve in your leg is affected.",
                    "Pain that Worsens with Movement: The pain often intensifies with certain movements like bending, twisting, or sitting for long periods. Activities that increase pressure on the spine, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing, can also make the pain worse."
                ],
                causes: [
                    "Age-Related Degeneration: As we get older, our spinal discs lose some of their water content and flexibility, making them more susceptible to tears and cracks. This is a very common cause.",
                    "Strain from Improper Lifting: Using your back instead of your legs to lift heavy objects can put enormous pressure on your spinal discs and lead to a herniation.",
                    "Trauma or Injury: A sudden impact, like a fall or a car accident, can cause a disc to rupture.",
                    "Repetitive Motions: Occupations or sports that involve constant twisting, bending, and heavy lifting can increase the risk of a herniated disc over time.",
                    "Lifestyle Factors: Being overweight puts additional stress on the spine, particularly in the lower back. Smoking is also a risk factor, as it can reduce oxygen flow to the discs, making them weaker."
                ],
                diagnosis: "A healthcare provider will typically begin with a physical examination, checking for tenderness, muscle weakness, and changes in your reflexes. They will also review your symptoms and medical history. To get a clear picture of the problem and confirm the diagnosis, they may order imaging tests such as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan, which provides detailed images of the spinal discs and nerves. An X-ray might also be used to rule out other potential causes of pain.",
                treatments: [
                    "Conservative Care (The First Step): Most herniated discs can be successfully managed without surgery. The primary goal is to reduce pain and inflammation and improve mobility. This often includes:<ul><li>Rest and Activity Modification: Taking a short period of rest from strenuous activities, while still staying active with gentle, low-impact movements.</li><li>Medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers (like ibuprofen) or prescription anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants to help manage the pain.</li><li>Physical Therapy: A physical therapist will create a personalized program of exercises to strengthen the muscles that support your spine and improve your flexibility. They may also use modalities like heat/cold therapy or massage.</li></ul>",
                    "Advanced Treatments: If conservative methods are not providing enough relief, a doctor may suggest:<ul><li>Epidural Steroid Injections: An injection of a steroid directly into the area around the spinal nerves to reduce inflammation and provide temporary pain relief.</li><li>Spinal Decompression: A non-surgical method using a traction table to gently stretch the spine and relieve pressure on the disc.</li></ul>",
                    "Surgical Intervention: Surgery is typically considered only if conservative treatments have failed after several months, or if you have severe symptoms like progressive nerve weakness, or loss of bowel or bladder control (a medical emergency). The most common surgical procedure is a microdiscectomy, where a small piece of the herniated disc is removed to alleviate pressure on the nerve."

                overview: "Despite its intimidating name, Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) is not actually a disease but a condition that describes the natural, age-related wear and tear of the spinal discs. These discs, which act as cushions between the vertebrae, can lose hydration, leading to reduced flexibility and a decrease in their ability to absorb shock. While disc degeneration is a normal part of aging, when it causes persistent pain and other symptoms, it is referred to as Degenerative Disc Disease. It is a common source of chronic back and neck pain.",
                anatomy: "The spine is composed of a stack of vertebrae with discs between them. These discs are like fluid-filled cushions with a tough outer layer. As we age, the discs can dry out and shrink, and the outer layer may develop tiny cracks. This process reduces the disc’s height and effectiveness, causing the vertebrae to sit closer together. This can put pressure on the facet joints and spinal nerves, which can lead to pain.",
                symptoms: [
                    "Chronic back pain: The most common symptom is a nagging, low-level pain that occasionally flares up into severe, disabling pain. The pain may last for weeks or months.",

                causes: [
                    "Aging: The primary cause is the natural process of aging, as discs lose water content and their ability to function as shock absorbers.",
                    "Repetitive strain: Activities or occupations that involve repetitive bending, twisting, or heavy lifting can accelerate the degenerative process.",
                    "Genetics: There is evidence to suggest that a genetic predisposition can make some individuals more susceptible to developing painful DDD.",

                ],
                diagnosis: "Diagnosis typically begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination. Your doctor will assess your symptoms, range of motion, and any nerve-related issues. Imaging tests are often used to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. An MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is the most effective tool, as it can show the dehydration and structural changes in the discs. An X-ray can also be used to check for disc height loss or the presence of bone spurs.",

                overview: "Retrolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra slips backward relative to the vertebra below it. This is the opposite of spondylolisthesis, where the vertebra slips forward. Retrolisthesis can occur at any level of the spine but is most common in the neck (cervical) and lower back (lumbar) regions. While minor cases may be asymptomatic, a significant slippage can cause spinal instability, nerve compression, and pain.",
                anatomy: "The spine's structural integrity is maintained by a series of interconnected bones (vertebrae), spinal discs, and strong ligaments. Retrolisthesis disrupts this alignment when a vertebra shifts backward. This can put abnormal stress on the spinal joints and surrounding soft tissues, potentially leading to a narrowing of the spinal canal and pressure on the nerve roots.",

                causes: [
                    "Degenerative Changes: The most common cause is the degeneration of the spinal discs and facet joints as we age. As the discs lose height, the joints become looser, allowing a vertebra to slip backward.",
                    "Trauma: A sudden injury from a fall, car accident, or other trauma can cause ligaments to tear, leading to a vertebral slippage.",
                    "Poor Posture and Core Weakness: A weak core and poor posture can put unnecessary strain on the spine, contributing to instability and a higher risk of retrolisthesis.",
                    "Infections or Tumors: In rare cases, infections or tumors in the spine can weaken the bone structure and cause a vertebra to shift."
                ],
                diagnosis: "Retrolisthesis is typically diagnosed using imaging tests. A standing X-ray of the spine is the most common diagnostic tool, as it can clearly show the backward displacement of the vertebra and allow the doctor to grade the severity of the slippage. An MRI or CT scan may also be used to get a more detailed look at the spinal nerves, discs, and soft tissues to determine if there is any nerve compression.",
                treatments: [

These small joints, located on the back of each vertebra, connect the bones and allow for the spine's bending and twisting movements. Facet Joint Syndrome is often caused by inflammation and degeneration of these joints, similar to arthritis in other parts of the body. It is a common cause of chronic back and neck pain.",
                anatomy: "The facet joints (also called zygapophyseal joints) are the bony connections between the vertebrae. They are lined with cartilage and surrounded by a fluid-filled capsule, which allows them to glide smoothly. Over time, due to aging, injury, or repetitive strain, the cartilage in these joints can wear down. This wear and tear leads to inflammation and irritation, which can cause pain and stiffness.",

                diagnosis: "Diagnosing Facet Joint Syndrome can be a bit tricky as the symptoms can overlap with other spinal conditions. Doctors will conduct a physical examination and may order imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, which can show signs of arthritis. The most definitive diagnostic tool is a diagnostic medial branch block. This is an injection of a local anesthetic near the nerves that supply the facet joint. If the pain is significantly reduced after the injection, it confirms that the facet joint is the source of the pain.",

This narrowing is most common in the lower back (lumbar stenosis) and the neck (cervical stenosis). While it can be present without any symptoms, when the narrowing becomes significant, it can lead to pain, numbness, and other nerve-related problems that can affect your daily life.",

Spinal stenosis occurs when either the central canal or the foramina become constricted. This can be caused by the degeneration of discs, the thickening of ligaments, or the growth of bone spurs. When these spaces shrink, they can pinch the spinal cord or the nerve roots, leading to the condition’s characteristic symptoms.",

                overview: "A stiff neck or back is a very common condition that is usually caused by simple muscle strain or sprain. It is a feeling of tightness or reduced range of motion that can be a nuisance and may be accompanied by pain. While it can be caused by more serious underlying issues, it is most often a temporary condition that resolves with a few days of self-care. The pain and stiffness can range from a minor annoyance to a debilitating problem that makes simple movements difficult.",

In the context of the spine, this most often occurs in the lower back (lumbar strain) and the muscles of the neck. A muscle strain can range from a mild injury, where only a few fibers are damaged, to a severe one, involving a complete tear of the muscle. While painful, most muscle strains heal with rest and conservative care.",
                anatomy: "The muscles of the back and neck are a complex network of fibers that support the spine and allow for movement. A muscle strain happens when a muscle is forced to contract too quickly or is stretched beyond its capacity, causing the fibers to tear. This leads to internal bleeding, inflammation, and pain.

This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness that radiates along the path of the affected nerve. The location of the radiculopathy determines the symptoms—for example, a pinched nerve in the lower back (lumbar radiculopathy) can cause symptoms to radiate down the leg (sciatica), while a pinched nerve in the neck (cervical radiculopathy) can cause symptoms in the shoulder, arm, or hand.",
                anatomy: "Spinal nerve roots branch off the spinal cord at each level of the spine, exiting through small openings called foramina. These nerves travel to specific areas of the body, carrying both sensory and motor signals. Radiculopathy occurs when a nerve root is compressed as it exits the spine. The pressure on the nerve interferes with its ability to function correctly, leading to the characteristic symptoms.",

                causes: [
                    "Herniated Disc: A bulging or ruptured disc is a very common cause of radiculopathy, as the disc material can press directly on a nearby nerve root.",
                    "Bone Spurs (Osteophytes): The body may form extra bone to stabilize the spine, but these bone spurs can grow into the foramina and pinch a nerve.",
                    "Spinal Stenosis: The narrowing of the spinal canal or foramina due to arthritis, thickened ligaments, or other degenerative changes can compress the nerve roots.",
